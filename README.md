# Interactive Map with Custom Layers using Folium

This project demonstrates how to create an interactive map with multiple customizable layers using the Python library `folium`. The map allows users to switch between different map views such as street view, terrain, satellite, and hybrid, all using a simple control interface.

With Folium, you can create visually engaging maps with minimal code, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with geographical data. Whether youâ€™re building a simple map or a full-featured mapping application, Folium simplifies the process by leveraging the JavaScript-based Leaflet library in Python.

## Project Overview

This project builds an interactive map centered on New York City, utilizing the Python `folium` library to create different map layers. The map includes layers such as OpenStreetMap, CartoDB Positron, OpenTopoMap (Terrain), Esri Satellite, and Google Hybrid (Satellite + Labels).

You can view the generated map in a browser and toggle between the layers with ease. This project serves as an example for anyone interested in learning how to create interactive maps with Python.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Folium** (A Python wrapper for Leaflet.js)
- **Web Browser** (For displaying the generated map)

## Features

- Interactive map centered on New York City.
- Multiple map layers: OpenStreetMap, CartoDB Positron, Terrain, Satellite, and Google Hybrid.
- Layer control widget for easy switching between map layers.
- Automatically opens the generated map in the browser.
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/folium-interactive-map.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   cd folium-interactive-map

3. **Install dependencies**:

   Install the required folium module using pip:
   pip install folium

## Usage

To create the interactive map, simply run the provided Python script:
python Folium_Customizing_Map_Layers.py

This will generate an HTML file (map_with_working_layers.html) that contains the interactive map. The map will automatically open in your default web browser.

## Map Layers Included

The project includes the following map layers, which can be toggled via the control interface:

1. **OpenStreetMap** (Default street view layer)
2. **CartoDB Positron** (A light, minimalistic street view layer)
3. **Terrain (OpenTopoMap)** (Topographical map for viewing terrain features)
4. **Satellite** (Esri's high-resolution satellite imagery)
5. **Google Hybrid** (Satellite imagery with street labels)

## How It Works

The core functionality is built using the folium library. The interactive map is centered on a specific geographic location (New York City) with multiple layers added for users to switch between:
